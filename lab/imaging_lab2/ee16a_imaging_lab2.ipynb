    "This week, you will scan a real-life image pixel-by-pixel using a projector and light sensor circuit (a.k.a. **single pixel camera**), and you will write code to display the captured image in your Jupyter (iPython) notebook. You will begin by checking that the circuit you built last time (with minor modifications) works and that the projector is properly connected to the computer. Next, you will write code to generate the \"mask\" patterns that the projector uses to scan the image. Then, you will use your generated mask matrix to photograph an image with the projector and ambient light sensor setup (seen below). Finally, you will write code to recreate the image from light sensor readings that are sent to your computer via the Launchpad.\n",
