    "This week, you will experiment with imaging methods that illuminate *multiple pixels* at a time. The multipixel illumination patterns displayed by the projector will come from a random binary matrix that you will generate. Before performing real imaging with the projector and light sensor (phototransistor) circuit, you will first step through a simulation procedure that helps you understand how multipixel imaging works (with an encryption-y spin). You will get a little taste of \"practical engineering\" (i.e. why translating theory into practice isn't as easy as it looks). You'll then apply these insights to real multipixel imaging, and then see a cool \"trick of the trade\" that allows you to more quickly image your drawing and get a robust result!\n",

As an example, for a 2x2 image, $H$ would need exactly 4 rows (one for each mask), and we would make 4 scans.\n",

But how can we illuminate various pixels in an example 2x2 image more than once while using only 4 scans and 4 corresponding imaging masks? The solution is to illuminate more than one pixel per mask, which motivates the question: how does one choose which pixels to illuminate with each mask?\n",

    "The ideal reconstruction demonstrated above works great, right? Unfortunately, due to real-world non-idealities alluded to earlier, if you directly tried to image a drawing with the multipixel masks in $H$, the reconstruction would probably look terrible. A significant amount of engineering effort is focused on how to best translate theory into practice by attempting to compensate for or remove non-idealities. In the following sections, we'll look at some of the worst offenders and what we can do to improve reconstruction quality.\n",

    "Although we won't be talking about noise in any real detail (that's something covered in more advanced classes), it's important to realize that both the light sensor circuit and the projector add noise that shows up in the digitized sensor output. Noise is what causes photos to look grainy or fuzzy. As an example, if your single pixel imaging system from last week happened to be very noisy (and usually, the cheaper $ the system, the noisier it is...), imaging the card from before might've produced something like: <br/><br/>\n",

At the same time, the amount of noise coming from the light sensor circuit and projector should stay mostly constant, thus improving the so-called *signal-to-noise ratio* (SNR) of our system. This is important to know when choosing `avg1sPerRow` for our random binary mask.\n",

The desired signal is always present, but the *random* error (noise) changes on each repeat scan. Thus, you can \"average out the noise\" at the expense of spending more time acquiring the image. This is actually what the Launchpad code you will use does under the hood.\n",

    "One big takeaway from this lab is that performing *real imaging* isn't as easy as you'd think. As we've seen, reconstruction via matrix inversion only \"works\" when 1) your imaging system isn't too noisy and 2) the matrix that you're inverting is \"well-conditioned\" (meaning that it doesn't have small eigenvalues that would result in noise amplification upon inversion). Unfortunately, you have no control over 1) and it's actually *really hard* to generate \"well-conditioned\" matrices.\n",

    "In Module 3, you'll learn about a really cool technique called Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) that addresses both questions above. OMP attempts to solve equations of the form $A \\vec{x} = \\vec{b}$. Specifically, it enables you to recover an $n$-length vector $\\vec{x}$ from fewer than $n$ *noisy* measurements, *assuming that $\\vec{x}$ is \"sparse\" in some basis* and $A$ is known. Our image is sparse in a special basis that you'll learn about in future classes, so we can use OMP! Actually, this fact enables techniques like JPEG image compression! You don't need to worry about the details now, but here's a little preview of the problem formulation in case you're curious. Recall that our ideal imaging system is modeled as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{s} = H \\vec{i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Our image column vector $\\vec{i}$ is not sparse. That means that most elements in $\\vec{i}$ are non-zero (the card is mostly white). However, our image represented in a special domain as $\\vec{x}$ *is sparse*. That is, the elements of $\\vec{x}$ are mostly zero. There is a relationship between our image represented as  $\\vec{i}$ and our image represented as $\\vec{x}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{i} = M_{IDCT} \\vec{x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $M_{IDCT}$ is a transformation matrix that allows us to go between these two domains. Because of this relation, we can reformulate the mathematical model of our imaging system as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{s} = H M_{IDCT} \\vec{x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $H$ and $M_{IDCT}$ are square matrices with dimensions $n \\times n$, $A = H M_{IDCT}$ will be a matrix with the same dimensions. Since $\\vec{x}$ *is sparse* (and we have $H M_{IDCT}$ and an estimate of $\\vec{s}$), we can use OMP to solve for $\\vec{x}$, and then back track to obtain what we actually care about: an estimate of $\\vec{i}$.\n",
